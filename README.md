#Vaccinator

The Vaccinator App is a digital vacciantion pass for the mobile phone. Users can add a vaccination, get reminders for follow up vaccinations or appointmens and manage their profile. They can also add multiple passes in one app, e.g. for parents and their kids.

We made this project in the course of a university lecture "Mobile Computing" as a group of three. We additionaly used SMART on Swift to use FHIR objects as medical data.
